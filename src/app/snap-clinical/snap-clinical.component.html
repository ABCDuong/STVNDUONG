      Working with clients and their requirements, wireframes were quickly produced 
      and development began shortly after client approval. An Angular 2+ skeleton 
      project was produced and development began as an in-house project before 
      snapClinical became what it was today. I joined in the front-end development of 
      the Management Dashboard shortfly after. 
      <br><br>
      I soon became the lead front-end developer of the Management Dashboard and was 
      involved in interviewing potential front-end developers. I would onboard new team 
      members to the system and its goals and requirements and would delegate tasks which 
      produced noticeable time efficiencies in project deliveries which continued to open 
      new doors for the company.
